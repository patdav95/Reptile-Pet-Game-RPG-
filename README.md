Starting things off with a simple SQL server on my old XPS 12 laptop, and a super basic Node.js Express API stemmed from this tutorial (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1239390/Creating-Simple-API-in-Node-js)

Once I plan out more of the functionality of the game, I will be expandinfg the API and developing a React Native mobile application.

Once the app is laid out, Iplan to dip into Unity, and see if I can construct a 2D version of the game, with more features.
